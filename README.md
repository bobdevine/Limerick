# Limerick Generator

(WARNING -- Early prototype!)

Generate a random limerick in a browser using built-in word lists.
The generated limerick follows the standard rhyming pattern of AABBA.

Sample limerick:
>     There once was a lion from Nantucket
>     Who removed a headlight near a tourniquet
>     She rolled the license
>     As if she laughed a senescence
>     Where the kitchen experienced the thicket

Limericks will be nonsensical, sometimes bizarre. The form, meter, and rhyme are unpredictable because the program chooses words randomly according to a loose grammar.

## Getting Started
Download all of the files and open "index.html" in any browser that supports Javascript.
